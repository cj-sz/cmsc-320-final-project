    "Welcome! When discussing data science in the field of finance and economics, things can be confusing. Not only are there plenty of ways to use data science in economics but there are dozens of topics that can be covered, such as economic forecasting or financial consulting. To make this learning process easier for any prospective data scientist, this tutorial has been made to guide you through the process of obtaining data, cleaning it, and modeling it for any future projects. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will be looking at using data science principles in the context of modeling economic health using GDP and GDP per capita..\n",
    "\n",
    "But what are Gross Domestic Product and Gross Domestic Product per capita?\n",
    "\n",
    "Gross Domestic Product, otherwise known as GDP, is the measure of the total monetary value of all goods and services produced in a country throughout a period of time and is typically measured anually. It is an enormous measurement, accounting for everything from gum at a gas station to professional medical services. It represents the production power of an economy and is used in a variety of applications from economic forecasting to policy making to business and investment strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gross Domestic Product per capita refers to an individuals average economic output. It is measured by dividing Gross Domestic Product by the population size. GDP per capita provides an indicaor for the economic prosperity and standard of living within a country. \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial we will be referring to any instance of Gross Domestic Product as GDP, and will be using a GDP per capita dataset alongside a C02 per capita and daily income datasets to create future GDP per capita predictions. To learn more about GDP per capita, its definition and its uses please visit [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/per-capita-gdp.asp).\n",
    "\n",
    "But how can we use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, when discussing how to use various metrics such as GDP, the \"how\" of the process is often overlooked or neglected. While it is not wrong to say GDP data can be used for all sorts of things, there are various questions as to how to clean, organize, and use the data that arise in the process. These questions are what the tutorial will answer today. \n",
